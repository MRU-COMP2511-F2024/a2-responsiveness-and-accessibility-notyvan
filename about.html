            <p>
                I don't actually promote the behaviour of these people. They are 
                fitness influencers that I do watch from time to time, for their 
                personalities not for their "fitness tips". Especially Togi, he's 
                the worst of them all, in terms of influence. He gambles, does a lot
                of drugs and is an extreme alcoholic. It's so bad that he himself 
                acknowledges that he won't live for that long. He also doesn't even work 
                out. I forgot that exact thing he said but he did mention that he wanted
                to compete in the IFBB (International Fitness and Bodybuilding Federation)
                without working out, solely by taking anabolic steroids.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Tren Twins on the other hand are just very entertaining people. If I 
                ever need just a boost of motivation or want to get hyped up, I watch them.
                Their music playlist for the gym is also nice to listen to, it gets me fired up.
                These guys are also much better, they don't take as much steroids, are even off them
                for a while now. 
            </p>

            <p>
                When I was doing the assignment, I didn't want to do the restaurant 
                website anymore. This is when I was watching a Tren Twins video, then
                spontaneously just made it about these guys. The content was supposed to be
                ironic, used chatgpt to make the description of these guys. 
                Hope that first picture of Togi gave you a chuckle.
