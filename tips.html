                    Meet Christian and Michael Gaiera, also known as the the <span>Tren Twins:</span> 
                    your future personal trainers and the ultimate
                    embodiment of hard work, dedication, and... questionable dietary
                    supplements. These two bring unparalleled intensity to their workouts,
                    with regimens so grueling you'll wonder if they were forged in a protein
                    lab. Known for their larger-than-life personalities (and even larger traps),
                    the Tren Twins are here to yell, sweat, and flex you into the best shape of
                    your life. Warning: side effects of training with them may include
                    spontaneous PRs, inexplicable cravings for chicken and rice, and a sudden
                    inability to fit through doorways.

                    Meet Shane Stoffer, aka <span>Togi</span>: the 'innovative' fitness coach who’s rewriting the rules of bodybuilding
                    —one groundbreaking transformation at a time. Known for his intense training methods and totally
                    <span>natural</span> approach to progress, Shane has a knack for inspiring others to push beyond their limits (and
                    maybe beyond their moral comfort zones). Among his greatest success stories is Alex Eubank, who
                    Shane expertly guided from clean-living competitor to embracing a more... enhanced perspective on
                    gains. With Togi in your corner, you’ll discover the true meaning of dedication, discipline, and ‘doing
                    whatever it takes’ to reach your peak potential. Don’t just build muscle—build your legacy, the Shane
                    Stoffer way!
