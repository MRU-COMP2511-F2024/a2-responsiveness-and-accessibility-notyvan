# Web Accessibility

## document the category of issues that you identified through the manual and automated analysis above
## In the automated analysis, I just forgot to put the title tags in every page, otherwise there were no "errors" only warnings. Some of the warnings included skipping header level, but I thought it didn't really matter that much. And as well as contrast warning, that being too dark of a text colour compared to the background which the text is on. But I decided to keep it to keep the colour palette of the website fluid.

## What kinds of changes did you have to make (I do not want a list here). Generalize the types of issues that you created when building your website, and then the general type of changes that you made to resolve those issues.
## The main issues that I ran into was due to my large monitor, the screen size looked normal to me until someone else checked out my website with a laptop or a different screen size. In order to address this issue, I tried to follow the template that was provided in the instructions and used that as a reference for my website. The media queries also fixed the issue for content layout as it addresses different screen sizes.

## How do these accessibility changes connect with the Gestalt principles we discussed earlier this semester? 
## The Gestalt principles allow for a website to have a fluid and clear structure. The accessibility changes allow for the web to be structured in such a way so that it has universal accessibility, making it easy to navigate by anyone.
